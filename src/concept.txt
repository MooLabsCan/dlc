Name (placeholder): Divine Lifecoaches

Goal: Give users a sense of purpose, belonging, and accomplishment through voluntary “discipleship” of a symbolic Divine Leader.

Core Themes:

History: Humans have always sought guidance from leaders or divine figures (Pharaohs, Tsars, gurus).

Psychology: Ritual, goal-setting, and participation in a larger purpose increase motivation and fulfillment.

Modern adaptation: A voluntary, safe, interactive, gamified experience.
